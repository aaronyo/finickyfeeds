FinickyFeeds is a simple feed reader that allows you to filter subscriptions
by tags.  More than that, FinicktyFeeds is my first experiment with Django and
JQuery -- a learning exercise.

After logging in, you will be able to access the two available pages,
"read" and "manage," via the links at the top of the page.


read
----

This page is where you can browse the articles found in your subscriptions.

If you've tagged your subscriptions, you'll be able to filter by tags provided
towards the top of the page.


manage
------
Here you can add, delete, and update tags for your subscriptions.

IMPORTANT: FinickyFeeds does not have any fancy feed "discovery" features,
so you'll need to provide the exact URL for an RSS or Atom feed definition.
If you are not sure how to find these URL's but want to play around with the
app, here are some sample urls to plug in:

Endgadget
http://engadget.com/rss.xml

Gizmodo
http://gizmodo.com/index.xml

Lifehacker
http://lifehacker.com/index.xml

Salt & Fat
